"""Agno Sidecar Integration

Use Tract as a version-control sidecar alongside an Agno agent.
Agno owns the tool call loop and live session. Tract versions every
message for branching, time-travel, compression, and provenance.

Demonstrates: Agno Agent with tools, Tract sidecar pattern,
              post-run message capture, branching experiments,
              config provenance across framework boundaries

Prerequisites: pip install agno
