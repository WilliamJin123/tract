"""Paradigm Benchmark

Setup: Run the full evaluation suite (01 + 02 + 03) across all three tool
       interface paradigms (programmatic, MCP, CLI). Same model, same scenarios.
Evaluates: Decision quality by paradigm, token overhead, error rate, composite score.

Demonstrates: Cross-paradigm matrix, composite scoring, statistical significance
