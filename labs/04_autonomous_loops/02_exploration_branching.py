"""Exploration Branching

Setup: Agent faces an ambiguous design decision with 2-3 viable approaches.
       Must explore each, evaluate outcomes, and choose the best.
Decision: Identify viable approaches, branch for each, explore, compare,
          choose and merge the winner.
Evaluates: Branch diversity, exploration depth, comparison quality, choice justification.

Demonstrates: branch(), switch(), compile() per branch, diff(), merge()
