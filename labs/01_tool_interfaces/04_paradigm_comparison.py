"""Paradigm Comparison

Setup: Run the identical budget pressure scenario through all three tool
       interfaces (programmatic, MCP, CLI). Capture decision quality, latency,
       error rate, and token overhead per paradigm.
Evaluates: Decision equivalence, latency, token overhead, error rate, robustness.

Demonstrates: Side-by-side execution of 01/02/03
Compares: All three paradigms on identical scenario, N runs for statistics
