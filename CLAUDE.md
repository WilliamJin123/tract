# Trace Project — Claude Code Instructions

<!-- tutor:triggers — auto-generated by /tutor:init, edit freely -->
## Tutorial-Driven Development
Before implementing any new feature or significant change, run
`/tutor:write` to draft a tutorial covering the planned approach.
After implementation is complete, run `/tutor:write --update` to
revise the tutorial to reflect what was actually built.

Tutorial conventions, focus weights, and quality bar are defined in
`.tutor/config.yaml` and `.tutor/GUIDE.md`.

## Other Project Rules

- Package imports as `tract` (previously `trace_context`)
- Source lives in `src/tract/`
- Tests in `tests/`
- Planning docs in `.planning/`
- Always run verification tests before claiming completion
- Use subagents for parallel independent work
