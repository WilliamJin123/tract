### Personal Weaknesses

- Pretty good with git, but not an expert
    - Niche commands, full depth of usage
    - Not too familiar with detailed git implementation
- No experience designing a good cli experience
    - How do i design clean interfaces for spawn pointers, viewing agent delegation trees
    - Take inspo from opentelmetry
- Decoupled design
    - CLI interface as well as an app to view “traces” (github of Trace) ⇒ how do we design that?
- GUI in the Collective
    - How to design this? TBD
