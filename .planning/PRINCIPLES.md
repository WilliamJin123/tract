1. Granular Control 
- Interjections at any point
- context window manipulation
- prompting and meta-prompting (policies)
- Granular configurations (different models, prompts hyperparams, for everything IF wanted`)
2. Anything a human can do, an agent / LLM can also do 
- HITL prompt interjection ==> AITL monitoring
- human-triggered context operations (rebase, reset, edits + appends, branching, etc.) ==> agent-triggered is possible
- Any human-exposed interface (apis, python functions, etc.) can also be exposed to an LLM (toolkits, customizable prompts, etc.)
- etc.
